Closer.js
=========

Closer.js is a Clojure parser written in JavaScript, compatible with the Mozilla Parser API
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API). It also contains a port of (much of) the Clojure core library.

It was created to be used on [CodeCombat.com](http://codecombat.com), a site that teaches users how to code by playing a game (there's multiplayer too!). CodeCombat is [open-source](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat), backed by [YCombinator](http://blog.codecombat.com/codecombat-in-y-combinator), participating in [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/codecombat), and is generally awesome all around. Go [check it out](http://codecombat.com)!
